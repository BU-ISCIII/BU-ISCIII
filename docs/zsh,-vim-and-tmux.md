# zsh, vim and tmux

## zsh

Despite bash is way more commonly used than zsh, and therefore all our scripts are written in bash for wider compatibility, zsh is more configurable. Used in combination with oh-my-zsh framework makes it much more friendly and easier to work with git repositories.

## vim

Vim, short for Vi IMproved, is a configurable text editor often used as a Python development environment. It is highly customizable, and we provide you with a guide to quickly set up our configuration.

## tmux

tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals to be created, accessed, and controlled from a single screen. It may be detached from a screen and continue running in the background, then later reattached. And even much more if you decide to play with its configuration or add some addons.
