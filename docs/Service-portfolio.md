## Introduction
BU-ISCIII is focus on the analysis of high throughput data (NGS) inside Computational and functional genomics. There are three service categories: 
- **Genomic data analysis:** bioinformatic analysis for different kind of data and experiments with fixed input and output files.
- **Bioinformatics counseling:** bioinformatic consulting for experiment and analysis design. Also if your research interest does not fit any of our fixed service offering ask of this service and we will evaluate a possible collaboration. Moreover we offer support for training: courses organization, internship, MSc/Phd thesis,...
- **User support:** we support installation of software in linux machines, and we offer the deployment of custom virtual machines in our server Bioinfo01 for researchers interested in performing their own analysis. Moreover we offer the possibility of develop small code snippets for specific functionality the researcher may require.
