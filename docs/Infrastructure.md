# Infrastructure

BU-ISCIII infrastructure comprises several levels of computing resources:

1. Workstations: personal computers located in BU-ISCIII labs.
2. Bioinfo01 server: BU-ISCIII server located in ISCIII's CPD.
3. HPC-ISCIII: shared high performance resource located in ISCIII's CPD.

A schematic (not realistic) image of the infrastructure would be the following, being each resource in a different sub network inside ISCIII's IT systems.
