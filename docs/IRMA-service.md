# IRMA

IRMA does not include quality trimming of the reads by itself. Therefore, before the execution of the pipeline the samples are analysed with FastQC for quality control and pre-processed with fastp.

## FASTQC

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) gives general quality metrics about your sequenced reads. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, per base sequence content (%A/T/G/C), adapter contamination and overrepresented sequences. For further reading and documentation see the [FastQC help pages](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/).

<summary>Output files</summary>

- `fastqc/raw/`
  - `*_fastqc.html`: FastQC report containing quality metrics.
  - `*_fastqc.zip`: Zip archive containing the FastQC report, tab-delimited data file and plot images.

**NB:** The FastQC plots in this directory are generated relative to the raw, input reads. They may contain adapter sequence and regions of low quality. To see how your reads look after trimming please refer to the FastQC reports in the `fastqc/trim/` directory.

## FASTP

[Fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp?tab=readme-ov-file#fastp) is a tool designed to provide fast, all-in-one preprocessing for FastQ files. It has been developed in C++ with multithreading support to achieve higher performance. This tools is used to pre-process the reads using multiple filters. For this specific workflow it is used for quality trimming and to filter any short-reads, adapters, polyG and polyX. This software includes in its output an html with several stats that show the state of the reads before and after processing.

## IRMA workflow

[IRMA (Iterative Refinement Meta-Assembler)](https://wonder.cdc.gov/amd/flu/irma/) was designed for the robust assembly, variant calling, and phasing of highly variable RNA viruses. IRMA is deployed for this service to analyse Influenza virus. IRMA is free to use and parallelizes computations for both cluster computing and single computer multi-core setups. You can read the [IRMA manuscript](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-016-3030-6#Sec9) for more background on the methodology.

**IRMA** uses several auxiliar softwares in its workflow:

- [BLAT](http://www.kentinformatics.com/products.html) for the match step
- [LABEL](https://wonder.cdc.gov/amd/flu/label), which also packages certain resources used by IRMA:
  - [Sequence Alignment and Modeling System (SAM)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9927713) for both the rough align and sort steps
  - [Shogun Toolbox](https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun), which is an essential part of LABEL, is used in the sort step.
- [SSW](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0082138) for the final assembly step.
- [MINIMAP2](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/18/3094/4994778) for the final assembly step (alternate option that may be useful for long - read assemblies).
- [samtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) for BAM-SAM conversion as well as BAM sorting and indexing
- [GNU Parallel](http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) for single node parallelization
